h1. Coral: 3-d Mathematics classes for Actionscript

Coral is a set of Actionscript 3 classes for 3D Mathematics. It includes the following classes

* Point3d
* Vector3d
* Matrix3d
* Quaternion

h3. History

Coral used to be part of the Flint Particles engine.

Prior to version 3 of Flint, Flint used it's own 3D Maths classes. With the release of version 3, Flint switched to use the native classes in the Flash Player. However, in making this change in Flint I discovered that the Coral classes are both faster and more accurate than the native classes (in Flash Player 10.2 and earlier), so I am making Coral available here for other developers to use.

Flint continues to use the native classes because that makes Flint more approachable for other developers, and by inlining some calculations rather than using the methods in Flash's Vector3D and Matrix3D classes, I was able to circumvent the issues in the native classes.

I continue to use Coral in all my 3D work other than Flint.
